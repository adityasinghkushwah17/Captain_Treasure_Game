This is a simple game developed using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose and it is also my first App. The game simulates a treasure hunting experience for a captain sailing on a ship.
Game Objective
The objective of the game is to sail in different directions and try to find as many treasures as possible. However, be cautious as there might be storms ahead!
How to Play

Launch the app on your Android device or emulator.
The game will display the current direction, the number of treasures found, and a message indicating whether a treasure or a storm was encountered.
Use the "Sail" buttons to navigate in different directions (East, West, North, or South).
Each time you sail, the game will randomly determine if you find a treasure or encounter a storm.
Keep sailing and collecting treasures until you're ready to finish the game.
When you're done, click the "Finish" button to see the total number of treasures found and the number of times you sailed.
